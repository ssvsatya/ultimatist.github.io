title: Time Series Analysis with Python
---

I recently presented at [ODSC East 2017](https://www.odsc.com/boston) on
### [FORTUNE-TELLING WITH PYTHON: AN INTRO TO TIME SERIES MODELING](https://www.odsc.com/training/portfolio/fortune-telling-python-intro-time-series-modeling)

My interactive presentation provided a pythonic tour of time series (alliteration heaven!) methodologies and packages, including ARIMA, seasonal models, and Markov approaches.

If you'd like to find out more, head over to [the github repo](https://github.com/ultimatist/ODSC17) where I hosted my notebooks and datasets.
