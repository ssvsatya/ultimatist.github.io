title: An Exposition on the No Free Lunch (NFL) Theorem
---

Another option is to perform a statistical significance test like chi-square before adding new structure, to decide whether the distribution of the class really is different with and without this structure. These techniques are particularly useful when data is very scarce. Nevertheless, you should be skeptical of claims that a particular technique “solves” the overfitting problem. It’s easy to avoid overfitting (variance) by falling into the op- posite error of underfitting (bias). Simultaneously avoiding both requires learning a perfect classifier, and short of know- ing it in advance there is no single technique that will always do best (no free lunch).
